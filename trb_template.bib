abstract = {Green space within residential areas is an important part of urban green space. However, in the past, these areas have not been completely open to the public and are only available to residents of the community within gated fences. At present, China has proposed to gradually open these closed communities, but quantitative assessment of the impacts of implementation on equity of green accessibility has not been explored. This paper selected Wuhan as a research case and used a Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment (2SFCA) and genetic algorithm to analyze and simulate whether the opened community policy would improve the equity of green accessibility, and how to best implement it. The main conclusions were: 1) The average green accessibility of the community within 1 km, 2.5 km, 5 km, and 10 km increased from 76.08, 75.50, 85.01, and 64.28 in the closed state to 102.43, 103.83, 114.39, and 94.87 in the fully open state; 2) After opening the gates, green equity was lower than before within the 1 km and 2.5 km thresholds, while opening the gates at distance thresholds over 3.6 km, green equity was promoted; 3) After optimization by the genetic algorithm, Gini coefficients for green equity were 0.39 and 0.28 within the 1 km and 2.5 km thresholds, and equity clearly increased compared to full community closure or full opening. This study quantified the spatial relationship between residents and green space and can be used to improve equitable spatial allocation of urban green space.},

Symbolic data analysis is a domain of research and application related to the areas of machine learning and statistics that provide tools to describe units (objects), enabling them to consider variability. Spatially correlated data are geospatial data with spatial autocorrelation, and the variability that comes from each region and neighborhood may be better expressed by intervals. Thus, this paper demonstrates the importance of considering the variability present in the interval variable and the variability present in geographical information. Experiments with synthetic interval data are performed to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. We also, analyze two applications, dealing with COVID-19 and rent price interval data.},

abstract = {Initializations of the petrophysical parameters significantly affect the results of reactive transport simulations on unstable dissolution fronts. As the phenomenon arises from the inherent heterogeneity of the rocks, heterogenous initialization of the petrophysical fields is needed to model such a phenomenon. While modeling of unstable dissolution fronts has been extensively studied in the past, the geostatistical information required to initialize the heterogeneous petrophysical fields is usually assumed and still missing. The objective of this paper is to acquire such information for Indiana limestones on a core-scale. This is done by combining high resolution tomography with pore scale calculations to determine: i) the rock minimum representative volume (REV), ii) the frequency distributions of the petrophysical parameters, namely; porosity, permeability, and reactive surface area, iii) the relationships between the petrophysical parameters, and iv) the rock spatial correlation model and lengths. The results obtained should help reduce the uncertainties associated with petrophysical initialization of core-scale reactive transport simulations of carbonate rocks in general, and Indiana limestones in particular.},

abstract = {Two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) techniques are popular for measuring potential geographical accessibility to health care services. This paper proposes methodological enhancements to increase the sophistication of the 2SFCA methodology by incorporating both public and private transport modes using dedicated network datasets. The proposed model yields separate accessibility scores for each modal group at each demand point to better reflect the differential accessibility levels experienced by each cohort. An empirical study of primary health care facilities in South Wales, UK, is used to illustrate the approach. Outcomes suggest the bus-riding cohort of each census tract experience much lower accessibility levels than those estimated by an undifferentiated (car-only) model. Car drivers' accessibility may also be misrepresented in an undifferentiated model because they potentially profit from the lower demand placed upon service provision points by bus riders. The ability to specify independent catchment sizes for each cohort in the multi-modal model allows aspects of preparedness to travel to be investigated.},

abstract = {Background: The two step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method has emerged in the last decade as a key measure of spatial accessibility, particularly in its application to primary health care access. Many recent 'improvements' to the original 2SFCA method have been developed, which generally either account for distance-decay within a catchment or enable the usage of variable catchment sizes. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various proposed methods within these two improvement groups. Moreover, its assessment focuses on how well these improvements operate within and between rural and metropolitan populations over large geographical regions.Results: Demonstrating these improvements to the whole state of Victoria, Australia, this paper presents the first comparison between continuous and zonal (step) decay functions and specifically their effect within both rural and metropolitan populations. Especially in metropolitan populations, the application of either type of distance-decay function is shown to be problematic by itself. Its inclusion necessitates the addition of a variable catchment size function which can enable the 2SFCA method to dynamically define more appropriate catchments which align with actual health service supply and utilisation.Conclusion: This study assesses recent 'improvements' to the 2SFCA when applied over large geographic regions of both large and small populations. Its findings demonstrate the necessary combination of both a distance-decay function and variable catchment size function in order for the 2SFCA to appropriately measure healthcare access across all geographical regions. {\textcopyright} 2012 McGrail; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed a growing trend towards transit-oriented development (TOD) as a critical approach for achieving sustainable mobility. However, some analysts and community activists have expressed concerns that TOD could induce gentrification and potential concomitant low-income group displacements. This paper presents a systematic review of 35 quantitative research-based studies presenting evidence on gentrification outcomes resulting from transit-based interventions, published between 2000 and 2018. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on this topic and thus provides a useful synthesis of current empirical evidence on transit-induced gentrification. Although there is some evidence supporting the transit-induced gentrification hypothesis, methodological flaws render many of the studies' conclusions highly questionable. The findings suggest that gentrification is more closely associated with existing local dynamics, built environment attributes, and accompanying policies than transit-oriented development. In its critical analysis of research approaches, this paper warns that the incorporation of several sources of bias into study designs may engender a number of misinterpretations, thus ultimately leading to misguided conclusions and policies.},

abstract = {The medical facility is one of the essential public service facilities. Its spatial accessibility is an important indicator to measure the convenience of access to medical services and a significant factor affecting urban development and the living standards of residents. With the constant process of urbanization, urban agglomerations are formed and developing rapidly. The high-tier healthcare facilities in an urban agglomeration no longer only serve a single city but multiple connected cities. How to characterize healthcare accessibility and supply-demand relationships between medical resources and residents in the context of the urban agglomeration is worthy of being studied but still not fully involved in existing researches. To fill this gap, based on the conventional enhanced two-step floating catchment area method (E2SFCA) and considering the regional development discrepancy and medical preference of residents in the urban agglomeration, this paper proposes a new hierarchical two-step floating catchment area method (H2SFCA) to analyze accessibility to medical facilities. The applicability of the newly proposed method is demonstrated with reference to the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan urban agglomeration case. The research findings suggest that: 1) A new method to evaluate accessibility to high-level medical facilities in the urban agglomeration is needed; 2) Due to the ignorance of intensive competition between potential demands, the healthcare accessibility in the core city is overestimated; 3) Residents' medical preference has various impacts on healthcare accessibility in different regions.},

abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is common in environmental factors, species distributions, and predator-prey interactions. Spatially autocorrelated distribution of prey and strong prey selectivity by predators may cause spatial autocorrelation of the fish diet shown as higher similarity among diets of fish caught nearby or in the same trip. We explore the importance of spatial autocorrelation analysis in understanding the fish diet composition and predator-prey interaction in diet analysis based on one example fish whitespotted conger (Conger myriaster) in the Yellow Sea and its prey species that have been monitored across seasons. Among the spatial estimators, the cluster-based estimator is used to quantify fish diet similarity from the same trip, and the spatial Gaussian and exponential autocorrelated estimators are used to test the hypothesis that fish diet similarity decreases over distance. The two types of spatially autocorrelated estimators performed better than spatially-independent and cluster-based estimators, with lower mean square errors in a cross-validation procedure. Prey selectivity related to the prey availability, and the spatial overlap between predator and prey were likely important factors affecting seasonal and spatial variations in diet composition of the example fish species. Cross-variograms indicated that whitespotted conger and some of its dominant prey species were positively spatially autocorrelated, which suggested fishes generally aggregated in areas of high prey density. Our study provides a practical basis for considering the effect of spatial characteristics in quantifying the diet composition likely linked to the environmental driven distributions of both fishes and their prey.},

To fill the void, this study investigates the equity in health workforce distribution in China by incorporating spatial statistics (spatial autocorrelation analysis) and traditional economic methods (Theil index). The results reveal that the total health workforce in China experienced rapid growth from 2004 to 2014. Meanwhile, the Theil indexes for China and its three regions (Western, Central and Eastern China) decreased continually during this period. The spatial autocorrelation analysis shows that the overall agglomeration level (measured by Global Moran's I) of doctors and nurses dropped rapidly before and after the New Medical Reform, with the value for nurses turning negative. Additionally, the spatial clustering analysis (measured by Local Moran's I) shows that the low–low cluster areas of doctors and nurses gradually reduced, with the former disappearing from north to south and the latter from east to west. On the basis of these analyses, this study suggests that strategies to promote an equitable distribution of the health workforce should focus on certain geographical areas (low–low and low–high cluster areas).},

abstract = {Purpose: While “Smart Growth”, Transit-Oriented-Development, and “Livability" have been around for years, little research has provided a framework to measure and understand their performance so we can realize key sustainability, livability, health, and equity outcomes. Procedures: In response, this paper builds on literature and practice to evaluate over 350 light rail stations throughout the US, using smart growth, livability, and Transportation/Land-use Coordination (TLC) principles. Using recently developed Livability and Smart Growth Equity calculators (http://bit.ly/SmartGrowthEquity), and a smart growth/livability place-typology framework, this research assesses and grades “livability opportunity access” performance of these station areas along such key dimensions as regional/local access to jobs, services, transit, walkability. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods, we show the significant associations between this livability access and the potential for realizing key quality-of-life benefits important for both individuals and society. But are all people able to equitably access these livability opportunities around transit so they can work towards realizing their desired quality of life? Findings: This study provides a unique evaluation of urban quality performance related to Transportation Land-use Coordination (TLC), “Smart Growth” and “New Urbanism. We find stations with higher levels of livability opportunity access to be significantly associated with key quality of life outcomes for individuals and society, such as lower rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, driving, carbon emissions, and even lower poverty and unemployment. These higher-performing stations also have higher rates of walking, bicycling, transit use associated with lower household transportation costs which offset higher housing costs. Unfortunately, these stations are not socio-economically inclusive – in sum, all stations are not equal, or equitable. Using livability-opportunity-access-assessments with livability ethics, we recommend transportation and land-use agencies coordinate policies to provide equitable access to opportunities so all people can pursue and realize sustainability, livability, health, and equity outcomes for themselves and society.},

abstract = {Spatial relationship models often use dependence relationships into covariance structures through the autoregressive model. The autoregressive process is shown through the dependence relationship between a set of observations or a location from now on called the dependent spatial model. The Spatial dependent model is divided into two categories: Spatial lag and spatial error. The spatial lag regression model is a model that considers dependent variables on an area with other areas associated with it, and the spatial error regression model is a model that takes into account the dependency of error values of an area with errors in other areas associated with it. Models with both dependencies are expressed as spatial autoregressive models with a spatial autoregressive error term (SAR-SAR). These dependencies resulted in the estimation of parameters by the ordinary least square method (OLS) resulting in inconsistent estimators. Therefore a special estimation method is required which results in a consistent estimate of the generalized spatial two-stage least square (GS2SLS). In this paper, we review the parameter estimation of SAR-SAR model with GS2SLS. To complete this paper, we also applicate of SAR-SAR model in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) case in Surakarta, Central Java.},

abstract = {Food desert studies attempt to identify geographic areas in which people lack access to sources of healthy food. While academic and policy research often defines access to food stores using simple Euclidean distance or road network metrics, dense urban areas with large public transit systems call for more sophisticated methods of determining access. It is particularly important to understand the level of access the transit-dependent population has to healthy food vendors, as their mobility is largely constrained by the routes and scheduling of their local public transportation system. In this study, we analyze public transit access to supermarkets in Cincinnati, Ohio. Using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data from the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) and the Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (TANK) and custom ArcGIS tools, we calculate the time it takes to travel from each Cincinnati census block to its nearest supermarkets at different times of the day. This transit-travel-time matrix allows us to investigate food deserts that change shape based on the time of day considered and to calculate the temporal variability in block-level access. Also, by combining this time-dependent analysis with census data on race, income, and age, we search for disparities in average levels of accessibility. The results of this analysis identify the areas and subpopulations in Cincinnati with the greatest need for improved access to healthy food stores and will demonstrate how schedule-dependent transportation can be factored into measures of accessibility. Ultimately, this study paints a more complete and realistic picture of food deserts in Cincinnati and helps policy-makers better target interventions aimed at mitigating their effects. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

A system-wide assessment of overall transit supply to the population in Melbourne, Australia shows that 70\% of the population shares only 19\% of the supply (Gini coefficient = .68). When employment is also taken into account, the situation is not much different; 70\% of jobs and population share 23\% of service (G= .62). In order to gain some understanding of vertical equity, the transit supply was compared between different age, income and vehicle ownership groups. There is some evidence of higher supply for youth and low-income groups in inner Melbourne, and in all parts of Melbourne no-vehicle households lived in areas of higher transit supply. Overall it is unclear how " fair" these distributions are compared to equity in other cities since this is the first time this method has been undertaken. Projects using similar approaches should provide a good basis for establishing comparative equity between cities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tao2020,
abstract = {Background: Spatial accessibility to healthcare facilities has drawn much attention in health geography. In China, central and local governments have aimed to develop a well-organized hierarchical system of healthcare facilities in recent years. However, few studies have focused on the measurement of healthcare accessibility in a hierarchical service delivery system, which is crucial for the assessment and implementation of such strategies. Methods: Based on recent improvements in 2SFCA (two-step floating catchment area) method, this study aims to propose a Hierarchical 2SFCA (H2SFCA) method for measuring spatial accessibility to hierarchical facilities. The method considers the varied catchment area sizes, distance decay effects, and transport modes for facilities at various levels. Moreover, both the relative and absolute distance effects are incorporated into the accessibility measurement. Results: The method is applied and tested in a case study of hierarchical healthcare facilities in Shenzhen, China. The results reveal that the general spatial accessibility to hierarchical healthcare facilities in Shenzhen is unevenly distributed and concentrated. The disparity of general accessibility is largely caused by the concentrated distribution of tertiary hospitals. For facilities at higher levels, average accessibility of demanders is higher, but there are also larger disparities in spatial accessibility. The comparison between H2SFCA and traditional methods reveals that traditional methods underestimate the spatial disparity of accessibility, which may lead to biased suggestions for policy making. Conclusions: The results suggest that the supply of healthcare resources at primary facilities is far from sufficient. To improve the spatial equity in spatial accessibility to hierarchical healthcare facilities, various actions are needed at different levels. The proposed H2SFCA method contributes to the modelling of spatial accessibility to hierarchical healthcare facilities in China and similar environments where the referral system has not been well designed. It can also act as the foundation for developing more comprehensive measures in future studies.},

This paper explores the issues related to the development of accessibility measures for non-motorized modes, namely bicycling and walking. We note that difficulties in calculating accessibility measures arise primarily from problems with data quality, the zonal structure of transportation planning models, and the adequacy of models and travel networks for describing and predicting travel by non-motorized modes. We present practical strategies for addressing these issues. The application of these methods is illustrated with the calculation of accessibility measures for a small study area in Minneapolis, MN (USA). The paper concludes with some direction for future development of non-motorized accessibility measures and ideas about their applicability to the practice of transportation planning.},

abstract = {Although the concept of social justice seems to be ubiquitous in most transportation plans, methods adopted to evaluate transit systems have little engagement with political theories to define justice. Without a proper definition, transport planners will be unable to design transit systems that achieve justice. The present study proposes a combination of sufficientarianism and egalitarianism principles to define justice in transit. Based on this framework 1) access to public transport is a right, 2) public transport should provide a minimum accessibility, 3) public transport should benefit the less well-off groups, and 4) a just distribution has to be spatially evaluated. The framework proposes a method that can be used to measure and compare justice in transit systems. The framework is applied to four case study cities, Auckland, Brisbane, Perth, and Vancouver. The results show that Auckland's transit system performs well relative to the other three case study cities by accounting for people and providing a minimum access to jobs. However, Auckland's transit services fail in the just distribution as it favours more affluent neighbourhoods. This issue is more severe in Brisbane's and Perth's transit systems. Vancouver, on the other hand, provides a better service for low-income neighbourhoods. This study contributes to the field of justice in transit by providing a clearly defined framework which can be adopted to analyse a city's transit system and compare it with other cities. It is expected to assist practitioners in obtaining insights that can inform policy decisions.},

The destinations are jobs, parks, groceries, hospitals, schools, and libraries. We show that there are clear inequalities across cohorts in the distribution of benefits that the transit system provides as measured by the number of reachable valued destinations. The results indicate that areas of low accessibility have a higher percentage of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, low-income workers, low-educated citizens, and the elderly. The most affected cohort are low-income workers, for whom access to jobs, parks, groceries, hospitals, and libraries decline as their number grows. The findings also highlight that inequities are most severe, in order, to jobs, hospitals, and grocery stores when examining the different cohorts. While transit agencies must deploy service with the existing demand in mind, the observed inequities behoove decision makers to make accessibility and equity considerations explicit in transit service decisions.},

Results show that lower levels of spatial accessibility to fire services exist in the most populated areas compared to those that are least populated. Further, we reveal that some areas are more likely to suffer a reduction in spatial accessibility than others. Spatial accessibility of population to fire services over the period to 2036 is likely to reduce as a consequence of rising demand for service. The identification of locales that experience lower levels of accessibility to fire services will enable fire services agencies to strategically plan infrastructure investment and help enhance the operational efficiency of emergency response.},

abstract = {The benefits and burdens of public transit service changes can be quantified using many different metrics. In the United States, the Federal Transit Administration requires transit agencies to assess the equity of proposed service changes using the demographic shares of affected riders. The purpose of the work presented here is to inform the development of more robust transit equity analyses than are currently conducted by integrating measures of accessibility – the ease with destinations can be reached – into FTA-required analyses. The measures are calculated using publicly available data, including the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset and transit route and schedule information in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format. The results demonstrate that relying on a single measure (e.g. population shares or accessibility) to associate a route with a particular demographic group is likely to be deficient. Previous academic work on accessibility has not translated well to practice in part because the calculation of accessibility relied upon regional travel demand model outputs that were difficult to obtain. This work thus fills an important gap in the literature and practice by tying advances in the academic literature to FTA-mandated analysis with publicly available data.},

However, these benefits are not always distributed equally among different population groups. This research seeks to determine whether the benefits of Toronto's public transit system are equitably distributed, and how these benefits change from 1996 to 2006 after the implementation of several transit projects in the region. We develop a methodology using a social indicator based on census tract level socio-economic characteristics to measure the relationship between social disadvantage and accessibility to jobs and transit travel time in the Toronto region over time. Transit equity is examined at three levels: spatially, temporally, and by job type. We find the range in accessibility and transit travel time narrows over the 10. year period. In addition, the most socially disadvantaged census tracts have statistically significantly better accessibility and lower transit travel times relative to the rest of the region in both 1996 and in 2006. Our findings show that Toronto has a generally equitable transit system that benefits those in social need, who are likely to gain the most from transit. The methodology proposed presents a useful way to bring issues of social equity directly into the land use and transportation planning process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This can be challenging due to the variety of equity perspectives and impacts. This article provides practical guidance for transportation equity analysis. It defines various equity types, impacts, metrics and objectives to consider, and describes ways to incorporate equity evaluation into a transportation planning process.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the concept of accessibility and how it can be incorporated in transport planning. Accessibility refers to people's ability to reach goods, services and activities, which is the ultimate goal of most transport activity. Many factors affect accessibility, including mobility (physical movement), the quality and affordability of transport options, transport system connectivity, mobility substitutes, and land use patterns. Accessibility can be evaluated from various perspectives, including a particular group, mode, location or activity. Conventional planning tends to overlook and undervalue some of these factors and perspectives. More comprehensive analysis of accessibility in planning expands the scope of potential solutions to transport problems. A},

abstract = {The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a growing interest amongst UK academics and policy makers in the issue of transport disadvantage and, more innovatively, how this might relate to growing concerns about the social exclusion of low income groups and communities. Studies (predominantly in the United Kingdom) began to make more explicit the links policy between poverty, transport disadvantage, access to key services and economic and social exclusion (see for example Church and Frost, 2000; . TRaC, 2000; Lucas et al., 2001; Kenyon 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Raje, 2003).By 2003, the UK Social Exclusion Unit had published and its now internationally recognised report on this subject, which subsequently resulted in the development of a set of transport policy guidances to local authorities in England to deliver what is now commonly referred to as . accessibility planning as part of their Local Transport Plans (. Department for Transport, 2006). Since this time, researchers, policy makers and practitioners in several other countries became interested in adopting a social exclusion approach to transport planning, largely because of its utility in identifying the role of transport, land use planning and service delivery decisions in creating and reinforcing poverty and social disadvantage.Eight years on from the SEU report, we can begin to reflect on the extent to which a social exclusion approach to the research of transport disadvantage has been successful in opening up new avenues of research enquiry and/or identifying new theoretical perspectives and/or methodological approaches. The paper begins by briefly revisiting the basic theories and core definitions which underpin and inform a social exclusion perspective. It then considers how these have been translated and understood in terms of transport. Secondly, it considers some of the emergent empirical research of transport-related exclusion that has attempted to measure and model the interactions between transport and mobility inequalities and relational negative social outcomes. Thirdly, it offers observations on progress in some key areas of policy and practice, with specific reference to the UK and Australia. It concludes by suggesting how further progress might be made on this issue and considers whether the social exclusion agenda is still a relevant approach for achieving this. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Jang2017,
abstract = {The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology for calculating the index of the spatial equity for the public transportation services for the city of Seoul using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient based on accessibility to the services. The index was estimated for 100 m × 100 m cells first and then aggregated for 424 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the city. The indices for Seoul's subway and bus were represented with and without the weighting factor. On the basis of this methodology, this study assessed the effect of an additional subway line on the spatial equity before and after its operation. Furthermore, an index of relative difference indicating the change in population and employment in the station areas was applied to investigate the changed effects of spatial equity between population and employment from the new subway line. The core findings from this research are summarized as follows. First, the subway network of Seoul provides more unequal public transportation services for the TAZs than for the bus network. Second, an improvement in the operation frequency of both transit modes would deepen the spatial inequity of Seoul. Third, a subway extension plan for Seoul could noticeably reduce the spatial inequity. The plan would improve the spatial equity for the population more than that for employment. The most important meaning of this study is to be found in combining spatial equity on the supply side with transit-oriented development (TOD) on the demand side. So, by establishing a TOD policy for the additional subway station areas, an appropriate land-use pattern can be established for maximizing potential ridership in consideration of the combination.},

@article{Bierbaum2021,
abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Transportation equity research addresses questions of participation and planning process or the distribution of transportation's benefits and burdens. This work largely elides issues related to youth and student travel. Existing work on school trip mode choice does not engage deeply with the equity implications of its findings. Education equity researchers identify the abstract notion of choice as equity enhancing but do not engage with the realities of disparate transportation resources and infrastructure. In this review essay, we articulate the contours of transportation equity, youth travel, and school choice research. We use emerging perspectives on “mobility justice” to frame the issues and provide vocabulary that can help bring education and transportation together in planners' everyday work. Takeaway for practice: A mobility justice framework encourages critical thought and action to address the root causes of inequities. Our conclusions make three contributions to research and practice: 1) challenging school district leaders to think about choice systems designed for access to schools, not just access to information about available options; 2) clarifying the broader implications of school choice by refusing to look away from the racial implications of forecasts; and 3) elucidating the need for a regional perspective.},
